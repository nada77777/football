It released worldwide on November 9, 2022, for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, marking the first cross-gen release in the series. It will be the ninth installment in the God of War series, the ninth chronologically, and the sequel to 2018's God of War.\n\nRagnarök is set in the world of Norse mythology but expands upon the previous game's narrative, with an even greater focus on exploration and open-world gameplay. While God of War (2018) allowed the player to access six of the nine realms of Norse mythology, Ragnarök's expanded focus sees the player exploring each of the nine realms, including the new additions of Svartalfheim, the industrial abode of the Dwarves; Vanaheim, the lush home of the Vanir gods; and Asgard, the golden land of the Æsir gods. Midgard, the primary realm of the 2018 installment, is heavily featured but is now a frigid wasteland, dramatically changed by Fimbulwinter, a three-year long winter that began upon the conclusion of the previous game. The Lake of the Nine, previously navigable by means of a boat in the previous game, is now frozen over. Svartalfheim is explorable to the same degree as Midgard was in the previous game. Alfheim, Helheim, and Niflheim all return, with an expanded focus and character exploration.\n\nTaking place three years following the events of the previous game, Fimbulwinter, a great winter that spans three summers, is drawing to a close which will begin the prophesied Ragnarök. Kratos and his teenage son Atreus begin to traverse the nine realms to seek out a means to prevent Ragnarök while attempting to uncover answers behind Atreus' identity as Loki. Their journey will lead them to Týr, the Norse God of War. Their conflict will lie with Thor, the Norse God of Thunder.\n\n#godofwarragnarok #godofwar",

                "description": "Karlous Bernard Miller is an American comedian, actor and rapper. He began his comedy career in Atlanta, Georgia and is widely known for his successful podcast/comedy tour The 85 South show, along with being a cast member on MTV's comedy improv series, Wild 'n Out, and his notorious \"Wildstyle\" battles with fellow cast members DC Young Fly and Chico Bean.\n\n\nIn this interview Marco greets Karlous and Karlous is immediately apprehensive of Marco and let’s Marco know. Marco starts with a softball question, “Who is Karlous Miller?”  Marco expounds upon Karlous’s answer and reveals that the production team found out that Karlous is big on relationships. The production team claims to know Karlous’s baby mama and takes out his phone and proves it. Karlous immediately changes his mood as the atmosphere tenses. Marco redirects the questions to women’s body parts and Karlous gives his opinions. The production team continues to make noise in the background. Marco goes into “fact or cap” and Karlous reveals he hears old people in his head. Marco is interrupted by the crew who are ignorant to who the guest is. Marco has an impromptu meeting with his staff as he is frustrated with the line of questions. Marco asks about Karlous being a Donald Trump supporter and the staff takes exception as they try to prove to Karlous and Marco that there are facts. Karlous watches as the staff and Marco argue on the set.  A staff member exits as Marco chases him and all hell breaks loose as other staff bring a monkey on set and Karlous reacts. Marco and the producer argue off set and Karlous is astonished at the monkey and hysteria. Karlous talks to one of the staff members and is baffled at the unprofessional antics and a monkey being put on his lap. The staff brings out another monkey and things get hairy. Marco attempts to reset and interview Karlous but Karlous is not in the mood. Marco is told by the producer he needs to reset and Marco is not hearing it. Marco tries to end the interview by getting a drop but that goes left as well. The staff continues to try and get it together as things go completely downhill…\n\n\nExecutive Producers for Breakbeat: Dave Mays & Brett Jeffries  IG @therealdavemays @igobybrettj\n\n\nExecutive Producers: Marco Summers & Harvey Sutton\n\n\nDirector: Matt Ables IG @mattablespromotions\n\n\nDirector of Photography: Militant Guerilla Productions\n\n\nFilmed on location at 4U Recording, Atlanta\n\n\nIG @BreakbeatMedia @FunnyMarco\n\n\nComment, like and subscribe on the Breakbeat Media YouTube channel, subscribe on Apple, Spotify or wherever podcasts are available, and visit us at www.breakbeatmedia.com",

                    "description": "Karlous Bernard Miller is an American comedian, actor and rapper. He began his comedy career in Atlanta, Georgia and is widely known for his successful podcast/comedy tour The 85 South show, along with being a cast member on MTV's comedy improv series, Wild 'n Out, and his notorious \"Wildstyle\" battles with fellow cast members DC Young Fly and Chico Bean.\n\n\nIn this interview Marco greets Karlous and Karlous is immediately apprehensive of Marco and let’s Marco know. Marco starts with a softball question, “Who is Karlous Miller?”  Marco expounds upon Karlous’s answer and reveals that the production team found out that Karlous is big on relationships. The production team claims to know Karlous’s baby mama and takes out his phone and proves it. Karlous immediately changes his mood as the atmosphere tenses. Marco redirects the questions to women’s body parts and Karlous gives his opinions. The production team continues to make noise in the background. Marco goes into “fact or cap” and Karlous reveals he hears old people in his head. Marco is interrupted by the crew who are ignorant to who the guest is. Marco has an impromptu meeting with his staff as he is frustrated with the line of questions. Marco asks about Karlous being a Donald Trump supporter and the staff takes exception as they try to prove to Karlous and Marco that there are facts. Karlous watches as the staff and Marco argue on the set.  A staff member exits as Marco chases him and all hell breaks loose as other staff bring a monkey on set and Karlous reacts. Marco and the producer argue off set and Karlous is astonished at the monkey and hysteria. Karlous talks to one of the staff members and is baffled at the unprofessional antics and a monkey being put on his lap. The staff brings out another monkey and things get hairy. Marco attempts to reset and interview Karlous but Karlous is not in the mood. Marco is told by the producer he needs to reset and Marco is not hearing it. Marco tries to end the interview by getting a drop but that goes left as well. The staff continues to try and get it together as things go completely downhill…\n\n\nExecutive Producers for Breakbeat: Dave Mays & Brett Jeffries  IG @therealdavemays @igobybrettj\n\n\nExecutive Producers: Marco Summers & Harvey Sutton\n\n\nDirector: Matt Ables IG @mattablespromotions\n\n\nDirector of Photography: Militant Guerilla Productions\n\n\nFilmed on location at 4U Recording, Atlanta\n\n\nIG @BreakbeatMedia @FunnyMarco\n\n\nComment, like and subscribe on the Breakbeat Media YouTube channel, subscribe on Apple, Spotify or wherever podcasts are available, and visit us at www.breakbeatmedia.com"

                    "description": "I had the greatest day of my life, the boys were shooting doubles under Western star-light, I rode a boat across the bay,\nPhoenix to Seattle to San Francisco, \nhearing Debbie laugh under downtown bar-glow, \nLouie telling me he feels free from yesterday,\n\nFrank a cup of coffee couple hours south, of the place I used to run around, when I was too young to really know, the difference in love and longing for it, when to shut up and when to stay with it, and how to forgive and just let go,\n\n‘Cause this is, the greatest day of my life, if I move or close my eyes, it’ll be gone and so will I, so come on in and stay awhile, years are just moments in a great big pile, and she’s there laughing on the porch swing of my mind, and I’m just grateful to be here at closing time, \n\nI had the greatest day of my life, wrote up a single in a New York sky-rise, how the city makes a country boy dream, played pool in Colorado after snow all night, it rained in Carolina but we played just fine, Charles is always better than last week, what did I do to deserve all this? A roof over my head and a band that don’t miss, a healthy dog that hugs me when I’m home, nowadays I don’t feel so alone, it can’t get better, but what have I ever known? \n\n‘Cause this is, the greatest day of my life, if I move or close my eyes, it’ll be gone and so will I, so come on in and stay awhile, years are just moments in a great big pile, and she’s there laughing on the porch swing of my mind, and I’m just grateful to be here at closing time, \n\nI had the greatest day of my life, the boys were shooting doubles under Western star-light, I rode a boat across the bay."
